# AREA2048

Fast-paced omni-directional arena shooter.

Clear a scene by destroying all the enemies that are in the scene.<br/>
If you touch an enemy body or enemy bullet, you loose a life.<br/>
When you clear 10 scenes, you proceed to the next area.<br/>
The game is complete when five areas are cleared.<br/>
If all areas can't be cleared in the time limit, it's game over.
